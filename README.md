# Job Scheduling System

A comprehensive web-based job scheduling system built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS that allows users to create, manage, and execute scheduled jobs with different timing configurations.

## Features

### Core Scheduling Features
- **Multiple Schedule Types**: Support for hourly, daily, and weekly job scheduling
- **Flexible Configuration**: 
  - Hourly jobs: Configure specific minute of the hour (0-59)
  - Daily jobs: Set specific time of day (HH:MM format)
  - Weekly jobs: Choose day of week and specific time
- **Job Execution**: Manual job execution with "Hello World" console output
- **Job Management**: Create, pause, resume, and delete scheduled jobs

### User Interface
- **Tabbed Interface**: Separate tabs for job creation and job management
- **Real-time Status**: Visual indicators for job status (active, paused, completed)
- **Job History**: Track when jobs were last executed and created
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

### Data Management
- **Local Storage**: Persistent job storage using browser local storage
- **Job Metadata**: Comprehensive tracking including creation time, last run, and status
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate UI updates when jobs are modified or executed

### Additional Features
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive input validation with user-friendly error messages
- **Toast Notifications**: Success and error notifications for all user actions
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Safe deletion with confirmation prompts
- **Console Logging**: Detailed execution logging for debugging and monitoring

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and functional components
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Shadcn/ui**: Modern UI component library for consistent design
- **React Query**: State management and data fetching (available for future enhancements)

### Components Structure
- `JobScheduler`: Form component for creating new scheduled jobs
- `JobList`: Display and management component for existing jobs
- `Job` type definitions: TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Responsive layout with tabbed navigation

### Data Persistence
- Jobs are automatically saved to localStorage
- Data persists between browser sessions
- Automatic cleanup and synchronization

## Usage Guide

### Creating a Job
1. Navigate to the "Create Job" tab
2. Enter a job name (required)
3. Add an optional description
4. Select schedule type (hourly, daily, or weekly)
5. Configure the schedule parameters based on type
6. Click "Schedule Job" to create

### Managing Jobs
1. Switch to the "Manage Jobs" tab to view all scheduled jobs
2. Use "Execute Now" to manually run any active job
3. Use "Pause/Resume" to control job execution
4. Use "Delete" to permanently remove jobs (with confirmation)

### Schedule Types
- **Hourly**: Jobs run at a specific minute of every hour
- **Daily**: Jobs run once per day at a specified time
- **Weekly**: Jobs run once per week on a specific day and time

## Future Enhancement Possibilities
- Integration with backend APIs for real job execution
- Email notifications for job completion/failures
- Advanced scheduling patterns (monthly, yearly, cron expressions)
- Job execution history and logging
- Import/export job configurations
- Multi-user support with authentication
- Job dependencies and workflows
